                            <h2>The latest S-Class is loaded with new features.</h2>
                        </div>
                    <p>The 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class is finally here. After an exhaustive campaign that included dozens of teaser videos and photos, and some vague details, the company has pulled the cover off its latest full-size luxury sedan at last. And there’s a lot to like.
                       Though it may not look all that different on the outside, the flagship four-door debuts with a laundry list of new engineering and technological innovations that promise to make this icon even better. Some of the most important new features include two hybridized engine options, a massive central touchscreen with the latest MBUX infotainment setup, and more active safety technology than ever before.</p> 
                       <div class="card-title-2">
                           <h2>Exterior: Aerodynamic Design</h2>
                       </div>
                    <p>Minor exterior changes bring the 2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class into the modern age. The hood is longer, the headlights and wheels are sharper – some shoes measuring in at 21 inches – the C-pillar flows more smoothly into the rear shoulder, and for the first time in three generations, the S-Class gets horizontal taillights.
                    </p>
                       <p>The door handles are now completely flush with the body, and there are new 'aerostripes' on the insides of the mirrors that help improve airflow. All of it helps yield a drag coefficient 0.22, making the S-Class one of the world's most aerodynamic cars. By comparison, the sleek Tesla Model S has a drag coefficient of 0.24.
                       In terms of size, the new S-Class is longer than its predecessor by up to 1.3 inches (in the long-wheelbase model), wider by up to 2.0 inches, and it stands about 0.4 inches taller. But to keep the class S-Class’ proportions in check, Mercedes also extended the wheelbase by 2.0 inches, the front track by 1.4 inches, and the rear track by 2.0 inches. So the 2021 S-Class maintains its athletic proportions, with a short front overhang, a modest rear overhang, and a sculpted profile, while offering more cabin space.</p>
                       <div class="card-title-2">
                        <h2>A Modern Take</h2>
                       </div>
                    <p>Obviously, the Benz's new 12.8-inch touchscreen is what immediately draws the eye – it floats up and out of the center console. But look beyond the new hardware and you'll realize just how much the inside of the S-Class has changed. The 2021 model has 27 fewer knobs and dials (mechanical switches, essentially) than the previous model – nearly all of those functions move either to voice or touch controllers.</p>

                        <p>Four horizontally oriented sleek new air vents sit on top of the dash, just above the screen – replacing the four rounded vents on the previous model – and depending on the trim, Mercedes offers full-length dash finishes like carbon fiber and piano black wood with pinstriping. There are also 30 loudspeakers and eight resonators available part of the Burmester high-end 4D surround sound system. Also new is the steering wheel, which has updated capacitive controls.</p>
                        
                        <p>The S-Class has a new generation of steering wheels with capacitive hands-off recognition thanks to a two-zone sensor pad in the steering wheel rim. The sensors on the front and reverse sides of the rim register whether the driver's hands are on the wheel. No steering movement is necessary to inform the driving assistance systems that the driver has control.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some of the same high-quality aluminum fixtures and shiny black trim pieces from the previous model do carry over, only now the latter are more prominent on the center console (again, depending on the trim) and around the seat controls on the door. The seats maintain the same high-quality, quilted Nappa leather finish, available in a few different colors. Those chairs also offer heating, ventilation, and 10 different massage functions, as well as new "Energizing" options accessible via the touchscreen.</p>
                        
                        <p>The optional Energizing features are a carryover from last year, and users can choose from six different Energizing options: Refresh, Warmth, Vitality, Enjoyment, Well-Being, and Training. Each one adjusts things like music, ambient lighting, seat positioning, and air conditioning to create the desired effect. And now for 2021, those same options extend to second-row passengers as part of the optional Energizing Rear package.</p>
                        
                        <p>to its stretched wheelbase and improved proportions, the 2021 S-Class also boasts a bit more interior room than its predecessor. Front headroom (42.0 inches) and legroom (41.0 inches) are about the same, but front elbow room grows by a solid 1.5 inches. And in the second row, there's an extra sixth tenths of an inch in headroom, 1.0 inch in legroom, and four tenths of an inch in elbow room. The trunk space grows by 0.8-cubic-foot, as well.
                        
                        One of the bigger standouts of the cabin is the new ambient lighting feature, which has an LED within an optical fiber every 0.6 inches. The goal, Mercedes says, is for the new ambient lighting fixtures to create a single continuous line of light throughout the vehicle. Lining everything from the door panels and the dash to the floorboards (even extending to the rear seats), there are around 250 fiber optic lights throughout the cabin.</p>

                            <h2>Bigger And More Advanced</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Inside the new S-Class, the 12.8-inch touchscreen comes standard, replacing the previous model's 10.3-inch screen. It's an OLED setup – like what you get in the new Cadillac Escalade – and compared to a traditional LCD, it offers crisper graphics, deeper blacks, and more natural colors, all while consuming 30 percent less energy.</p>

                        <p>touchscreen runs an updated version of Mercedes-Benz's lauded MBUX infotainment system, which means features like the "Hey, Mercedes" voice assistant carries over. But now "Hey, Mercedes" is a bit more intuitive; it can explain basic functions like Bluetooth connectivity, answers to commands like "accept call," and even understands up to 27 different languages. Plus, now even second-row passengers can use it.</p>
                        
                        <p>Another carryover of MBUX is the augmented-reality navigation feature, and much like voice command, it also receives some updates. The AR navigation now projects a crisper readout onto the head-up display – which corresponds to a massive 77.0 inches diagonally – instead of the central screen, and can project an image virtually at a distance of up to 33 feet (10 meters).</p>
                        
                        <p>Joining that massive central screen are up to four other screens strategically placed throughout the cabin. The first is a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster that combines both a digital LCD and practical elements to create a 3D-like effect that tracks the driver’s eye movement – and like the previous version, this one is highly configurable and customizable. The digital cluster has four different settings: Discreet, Sporty, Exclusive, and Classic.</p>
                        <div style="font-weight: bold;">
                            <p>*Discreet: Seven different color schemes, 64 ambient lighting colors</p>
                            <p>*Sporty: Red instrument cluster colo, dynamic rev counter</p>
                            <p>*Exclusive: White mother-of-pearl color, night mode automatically switches to darker display</p>
                        </div>
                        There are also three optional screens available in the rear: two 11.6-inch entertainment displays mounted to the front seatbacks and a third removable 7.0-inch tablet in the center console as part of the Business Center Console package that controls the rear two. Both the driver and rear passengers can access personal profiles on the center screen and those rear seat screens via voice command, each with their own music and multimedia options. And each screen can hold up to seven different user profiles.</p>
